## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/xobQBuf8zWWmiYMIAZe0) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

The header is responsive to the width of the device, hiding the menu links with `display: none` on small screen devices. It displays the hamburger menu by re-arranging the header elements, through CSS and a little of JS, re-utilizing the DOM elements.

The cards in the Services section are animated.

All images are responsive.
